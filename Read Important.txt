Hiii...

Step 1 --> Copy admin, admin-home, show-message, show-customer folders directly into app folder.
You will find app folder as follows FCropApp > src > app

Step 2 --> Copy Contact.ts file in model folder
You will find model as follows FCropApp > src > app > model

Step 3 --> Open service.txt file you will find some functions copy it in fcrop-service.service.ts file.
You will find model as follows FCropApp > src > app > fcrop-service.service.ts

Step 4 --> Open module.txt file you will find some functions copy it in app.module.ts file.
You will find model as follows FCropApp > src > app > app.module.ts

Now you will encounter some errors in step 3 and step 4 respectively, To remove them just import all the components and modules. It will work fine.



It Works.. __/|\__  :-)
